# Ethical-Hacking

In this repository, I will organize the various subjects I'm studying to become an ethical hacker. I'm currently studying OS, networking, web hacking, databases, and other topics. I plan to keep adding new subjects as I progress. I'm not sure if I can stay consistent in the long run since I tend to lack persistence, but I'll give it a try anyway.


## Topics

 - Operating System
 - Database
 - Networking
- Digital Forensic
