# Getting Started with Nmap

## Before we start

### Prerequisite: 
basic understanding of networking concepts such as IP addresses, ports, and protocols (TCP/UDP). 
Familiarity with command-line interfaces (CLI) is also helpful since Nmap is primarily used via the terminal.

### Why use Nmap?
Nmap (Network Mapper) is a must-have tool for network scanning and security auditing. It helps you discover devices on a network, identify open ports, and find vulnerabilities. 
Whether you're a network admin or a security enthusiast, Nmap is an essential tool for managing and securing networks.

### Installation
If you're using Kali Linux, Nmap is already installed by default. 
For other Linux distributions, you can install it using your package manager:


- Debian/Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt install nmap
```
- CentOS/RHEL:
```
sudo yum install nmap
```

- Windows :
For Windows users, download the installer from the Nmap official website. 

- macOS :
If you’re on macOS, the easiest way to install Nmap is via Homebrew. 
Install Homebrew first if you haven’t, and then run:

```
brew install nmap
```
